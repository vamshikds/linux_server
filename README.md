# linux_server via VPS
Linux Server Admin via Windows 11 through vps

1. Go to terminal/command prompt by typing **`cmd`** in windows search or by clicking **`windows key + R`** then entering **`cmd`** in the prompt.
    - Type **`winget`** in windows terminal to check the version of windows package manager - The **`winget`** command line utility enables installing applications and other packages from the command line. **WinGet** (short for Windows Package Manager) is a free and open-source command-line package manager. It's a tool that allows one to easily discover, install, upgrade, and manage applications on the computer using simple text commands in the terminal.
    - Command prompt of **`winget`** is: **`winget [<command>] [<options>]`**
    - Search for Microsoft Powershell.
        - Type: **`winget search Microsoft.Powershell`**.
        - If prompted to agree to source terms, type **\<Y\>** to agree and continue.
        - Now install the powershell by typing: **`winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget`**
        - It will install PowerShell.
        - Exit the Windows Terminal by typing **`exit`** and then press enter.
2. Now there will be two different, coexisting versions of PowerShells installed.
    -  **Windows PowerShell (Version 5.1):**
        -  This is the classic, built-in version of PowerShell that is pre-installed with Windows.
        -  The executable name is **`powershell.exe`**. When you type **"PowerShell"** or **`powershell.exe`** in the windows search, you are starting this version.
        -  To check its version simply type **`$PSVersionTable`** in the Windows Powershell terminal when you start it by using the above commands.
        -  The version listed will be 5.1.xxxxx.xxxx
        -  It is no longer actively developed for new features, only security patches.
    - **PowerShell (Version 7.x - formerly PowerShell Core):**
        - This is the modern, cross-platform version you installed using **`winget`** (version 7.5.x.x).
        - the executable name is **`pwsh.exe`**. To start this version simply type this in the windows search.
        - It installs side-by-side with Windows PowerShell 5.1, it does not replace it.
        - To check its version type **`pwsh --verion`** in either Windows Powershell or in Windows Terminal or even in the terminal which opens when you run **`pwsh.exe`** in the windows search.
        - The version listed will be 7.5.x.
        - It is actively developed and built on .NET.
3. Installing **SSH Key** to connect with VPS and your local laptop:
    - **Ed25519** is modern, secure, fast and current defacto recommended cryptographic key type for OpenSSH and shorter and quicker than RSA key type.
        - Run Dialog Box and press **Windows key + R** and type **`pwsh`** to open **PowerShell 7** or type **`powershell`** to open **Windows Powershell 5** 
        - Use command **`-t`** for selecting key type (select one of these **`ed25519`** or **`rsa`** or **`ecdsa`** or **`dsa`**) and
        - Use command **`-C`** for comment, the comment is only for your reference and not for security purpose.
        - Type this command and enter: **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your comment"`**
        - Then it enter again to confirm the **.ssh folder** location, its best to keep the same and not to modify
        - Then it pops it asks to enter a **passphrase**, its recommended to generate one like your password and then enter
        - Then it generates the **key fingerprint** and **randomart image**
        - The default **Key Derivation Function (KDF)** rounds fore newer OpenSSH keys is often **16 rounds.**
            - A **Key Derivation Function (KDF)** is a cryptographic algorithm that acts like a highly specialized, ultra-secure recipe for turning one secret value into one or more new, stronger, and cryptographically safe secret keys.
            - KDF iterations means how difficult it is to get the key from your password. The purpose is to intentionally slow down brute-force attacks on your password, as an attacker would have to perform those 100 slow operations for every password guess.
            - To increase the KDF rounds we can use **`-a`** command and specifc the number of rounds like: **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100`**, here the number of KDF rounds will be 100.
            - **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 256 -C "your comment"`** this generates a ed25519 key with 256 KDF counts
            - **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f testkey100 -N "testpass" -C "benchmark100"`** this will generate a key with 100 KDF counts with a filename testkey100 with a passphrase of testpass and comment benchmark100.
            - **`Mearsure-Command { ssh-keygen -y -f testkey100 }`** this will measure the time taken to unlock the public key from a private key using **`ssh-keygen -y`** command.
    - To delete files via powershell:
        - Use this command **`rm yourfilename`** then press enter to delete files if you have created to test the benchmarking
        - before this check the number of files or sub-directories in your current directory by simple tying **`ls`** command and then enter.
    - Initial command:
        - This command: **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 256 -C "my_laptop"`** this will generate ed25519 key with 256 rounds of KDF and with a comment for your reference as my_laptop.
        - Then the powershell or your terminal will ask to give a file name, if you enter, this will be considered as its new file name, else it will generate SSH keys with file name as **id_ed25519** for private key and **ed_25519.pub** for public key.
        - Then this proceeds further and asks for a **passphrase**, its like a password for your SSH Key. **ITS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ENTER A VERY STRONG PASSPHRASE** to secure your connection even though you use your own machine or laptop to store these ssh keys.
        - now you will have two keys stored in your **.ssh** folder (hidden) in your home directory with names like **id_ed25519** and **id_ed25519.pub**.
        - copy the contents of your public key, never share your private key.
            - in the powershell use **`cat id_ed25519.pub`** command to view the contents of your public key, copy the entire key including that of your given comment and paste it in your vps.
    - Ways to secure passwords or passphrase:
        - A useful too to secure passwords is my using **KeePass** password manager which is safe and secure and completly in your local machine.
        - Download the latest version for windows.
4. Connecting with the server:
    - Initial steps:
        - Connect with your VPS server through your laptop/local machine by entering the public ssh key into your vps control panel by reinstalling the OS.
        - Wait for your vps service provider to confirm that the OS has been reinstalled with your public SSH.
        - Next, go to Powershell and enter **`ssh your_username@your_ipv4`**, then it will ask you to confirm if you want to connect with this new IP, type **`yes`**. Then it will ask you to enter the **passphrase** of your SSH key, enter it.
        - Next, It will ask you to change the password immediately, do it by entering the existing password and entering the new one.
        - Next, it will close the connection to your ipv4.
        - Now, re-enter **`ssh your_username@ipv4`** and then your passphrase for the SSH Key.
        - Now, you are successfully connected with the your server.
    - To check your userID details:
        - Type **`id`** to get initial details
        - Type **`id -gn`** to check the user groupID name
        - Type **`id -un`** to check the user name without **`-n`** it will give only the id number
        - Type **`id -Gn`** to check all the groups in which the user is allowed in
        - Type **`sudo -l`** if your user is allowed to run the **`sudo`** command or
        - Type **`sudo whoami`** to check if you have sudo access. **`whoami`** is simply **Who Am I**, it tells the user is what, if the user has sudo access it tells otherwise it says the user is not in the sudoers file.
        - Type **`whoami`** to get your username.
        - Type **`sudo su username`** to switch to another userid - can do it only when the current user is part of sudoers group. Else type **`exit`** to exit a subuser and get into original sudo user account.
